# ReactPortfolio

## General Information

This project is an updated version of my portfolio page that displays what I've learned throughout the course so far in order to become employer-competitive. 
This portfolio features my best homework assignments. I have also updated my LinkedIn and GitHub profile information, and I also updated my resume. 
My updated portfolio page includes links to these profiles, a downloadable PDF version of my resume, exemplary assignments with links, and my contact information. 
I used React amd Bootstrap CSS framework to ensure a mobile-responsive user interface and edited the CSS to look polished and unique. The site is deployed to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)
